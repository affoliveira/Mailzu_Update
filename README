			MailZu
		====================

MailZu is a quarantine management interface for amavisd-new
( http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/ ).

It provides users and administrators access to email that is suspected to be
spam or contain banned contents and gives users the ability to release, request,
or delete these messages from their quarantine.

Users can access their personal quarantine by authenticating to various
pre-existent backends such as LDAP ( or Active Directory ) or any PHP PEAR
supported database.

See the INSTALL file in the docs/ directory included with this distribution.
