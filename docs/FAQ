Frequently Asked Questions
=======================================

1) What is MailZu?

  MailZu is a quarantine management interface for amavisd-new. It allows
users to view their quarantined items and request release (for suspect malware),
release, or mark them for deletion.

2) What version of amavisd-new do I need?

  MailZu will work with amavisd-new greater than 2.3.0.

3) Does MailZu support multiple amavisd-new instances?

  Yes. If every amavisd-new instance in your environment stores its data into
the same SQL database there should be no problem. The only limitation is that
the AM.PDP protocol must listen on the same port for each amavisd-new
instance.

4) Do I have to configure amavisd-new to quarantine email to SQL?

  No. MailZu does not require that the actual message bodies be kept in SQL.
Release is handled by amavisd-new, so MailZu need not be aware of the location
of the quarantine. Quarantine to SQL is only neccessary if you want your users
to be able to view spam in the MailZu interface, otherwise they will only see 
the basic headers of the quarantined message.

5) Why do some or all messages in the MailZu message index not viewable?

  The reason might be that email is not quarantined to SQL. This can be enabled
by setting these variables in amavisd-new:

  $banned_files_quarantine_method = 'sql:';
  $spam_quarantine_method         = 'sql:';

6) Releasing messages does not seem to work. What is wrong?

  There may be a couple of reasons for this behavior. The most common problems
is that PHP is not built with sockets enabled ( --enable-sockets ), or it is
a network related issue.

  The first problem is easy to diagnose and fix. If releasing emails is still 
not working, then we have to diagnose the network problem.

  It is important to understand that in order for MailZu to support more than
one amavisd-new instance, it must connect to the appropriate host. The correct
host is retrieved from the SQL record inserted by amavisd-new. Check the 'host'
column of the 'msgs' table. Please make sure that you can connect to the AM.PDP 
port of the host listed in that record from the host that runs MailZu.

  user@mailzuhost# telnet <host in SQL record> <AM.PDP port>

If a connection is not made, then review your amavisd-new configuration regarding
the interfaces it listens on, and the ACLs regarding connecting clients. Be
careful, the AM.PDP protocol does not send a greeting or any data whatsoever on
a successful connection. It may appear that a connecion did not work, when in fact
it did.

7) Where can I get support?
