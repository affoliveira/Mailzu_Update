Active Directory Autentication Settings
----------------------------------------

To configure MailZu to authenticate users against Active Directory.
Edit the config/config.php and tailor the variables mentioned here for your
environment.

  // Set an authentication method: 'ldap','ad', or 'sql'
  $conf['auth']['serverType'] = 'ad';

Set the AD host(s) and search base

  // List of AD Domain controllers 
  $conf['auth']['ad_hosts'] = array( 'dc1.example.com' );
  // if set to true, LDAP connection over SSL (PHP 4.0.4 minimum)
  // if set to false or not set, unencrypted LDAP connection on port 389
  $conf['auth']['ad_ssl'] = false;

  // AD base dn, e.g. 'dc=example,dc=com'
  $conf['auth']['ad_basedn'] = 'dc=example,dc=com';

Set the Active Directory domain:

  // AD domain, e.g. 'example.com'
  $conf['auth']['ad_domain'] = 'example.com';

Set the attribute usually used to identify a user in Active Directory:

  // AD attribute used to identify a person
  $conf['auth']['ad_user_identifier'] = 'samaccoutname';

Now we must set the login format. For AD the default is the 'samaccountname'
attribute, or if you want a fully qualified email address as the login, it
could be 'mail'. 

  // AD attribute used as login, e.g. 'samaccountname' or 'mail'
  $conf['auth']['ad_login'] = 'samaccountname';

At the login page of MailZu, with this setting the user would use the login
'user', or if the configuration variable was set to the 'mail' attribute, the
login would be 'user@example.com'.

These two attributes are enough to be authenticated to the MailZu interface,
but the third attribute is what determines which messages the authenticated
user is permitted to view. This attribute is the final recipient address. It is
the email address that amavisd-new reports as the envelope recipient. 

For example, if the login used was 'user', than there must be an attribute or
field that determines the email address associated with this user. Even if the
login was 'user@example.com' the third attribute may or may not be the same.
The address might have been aliased to an internal address 
'user@internal.example.com'.

  // AD mail attribute used as the final recipient address
  // Could be the actual mail attribute or another attribute
  // (in the latter case look for the "%m" token in the ldap query filter in 
  // amavisd.conf)
  $conf['auth']['ad_mailAttr'] = 'mail';

If the attribute listed for the login format is not the same as the binding 
username, we must be able to search the directory. The settings below binds 
using this account to search the directory. AD does not allow anonymous
binds.

  $conf['auth']['ad_searchUsername'] = 'manager';
  $conf['auth']['ad_searchPassword'] = 'secret';

If you want to specify the name of the user in the welcome message, you need to set the parameter below. AD attribute such as 'g
ivenName', 'cn' or 'displayName' can be used:
$conf['auth']['ad_name'] = 'givenName';
