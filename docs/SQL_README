SQL Autentication Settings
-------------------------------

To configure MailZu to authenticate users against a PEAR compatible SQL 
database...

  // Set an authentication method: 'ldap','ad', or 'sql'
  $conf['auth']['serverType'] = 'sql';

Set the type of database to authenticate to...
  /*** Database Authentication Settings ***/
  // Database type to be used by PEAR
  /* Options are:
        mysql  -> MySQL
        pgsql  -> PostgreSQL
        ibase  -> InterBase
        msql   -> Mini SQL
        mssql  -> Microsoft SQL Server
        oci8   -> Oracle 7/8/8i
        odbc   -> ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
        sybase -> SyBase
        ifx    -> Informix
        fbsql  -> FrontBase
  */
  $conf['auth']['dbType'] = 'mysql';

Set the SQL host with optional port

  // Database host specification (hostname[:port]) 
  $conf['auth']['dbHostSpec'] = 'dbhost';

Specify the credentials needed to access the database

  // Database user who can access the auth database
  $conf['auth']['dbUser'] = 'user';

  // Password for above user to auth database
  $conf['auth']['dbPass'] = 'pass';

  // Name for auth database
  $conf['auth']['dbName'] = 'dbname';

  // Name for auth table that contains usernames and passwords
  $conf['auth']['dbTable'] = 'dbtablename';

  // Name of the 'first name' or 'full name' field of the SQL table
  // If such a field does not exist, leave it blank
  $conf['auth']['dbTableName'] = 'givennamefield';

Now we must set the login format. 

  // Name of the Username field of the SQL table
  $conf['auth']['dbTableUsername'] = 'usernamefield';

At the login page of MailZu, with this setting the user would use the value 
listed in the above field, which may or may not be the fully qualified email
address.

Now we must set the field for the password.

  // Name of the password field of the SQL table
  $conf['auth']['dbTablePassword'] = 'passwordfield';

Is the password stored in the database the MD5 digest?

  // true   = passwords are stored md5 encrypted in database
  // false  = passwords are stored cleartext in database
  $conf['auth']['dbIsMd5'] = true;

These two attributes are enough to be authenticated to the MailZu interface,
but the third attribute is what determines which messages the authenticated
user is permitted to view. This attribute is the final recipient address. It is
the email address that amavisd-new reports as the envelope recipient. 

For example, if the login used was 'user', than there must be an attribute or
field that determines the email address associated with this user. Even if the
login was 'user@example.com' the third attribute may or may not be the same.
The address might have been aliased to an internal address 
'user@internal.example.com'.

  // Name of the 'mail address' field of the SQL table
  $conf['auth']['dbTableMail'] = 'mailaddress';
