  the encoding of the database.

  If you are using the binary type on this column, set

    $conf['db']['binquar'] = True;

  in your config.php.

- Support for recipient delimiters. New option in config.php.
  
    $conf['recipient_delimiter'] = ''; // set to '+' or any delimiter 

  Only one character for the delimiter is supported. Contribution by Brice Figureau.

  system PEAR libraries instead.

MailZu 0.7b:
----------

- Added compatibility for amavisd-new 2.4.0 or later database schema. Needed for
  proper handling of file-based quarantining.

  If you are currently using amavisd-new 2.4.0 or later, no changes are necessary.

  If you are using a version of amavisd-new prior to 2.4.0 (with old database 
  schema), please add the 'quar_loc' column to your 'msgs' table with:

    ALTER TABLE msgs ADD quar_loc varchar(255) DEFAULT '';
  
  This is a mandatory requirement for this version and future versions of MailZu.
  In other words, MailZu does not care which version of amavisd-new you are running,
  as long as the SQL tables match those that are needed by amavisd-new 2.4.0 or  
  later.

- Specific SQL queries when listing a quarantine index tended to be optimized when
  using MySQL only. These queries are now used only when the site configures MySQL 
  as their backend. Faster and efficient queries are now the default when any other
  database is chosen. 

- Admins should have been able to login even though the configuration parameter 
  login_restriction was set to 'true'. This was not the case and was fixed to work
  as intended.

- In a quarantine index, deleting all the items on the last page would then return
  a page with no results. Fixed. Reported by Paolo Cravero.

- In a quarantine index, using the "Delete All" button would delete the items on
  the first page only. This has been fixed to include all items in a quarantine index.
